With the latest update we introduce user Avatars. Each user has been randomly assigned an avatar. You can re-randomize yours on the [Settings page](https://chroma.vision/settings).

We've also added the ability to link a blockchain account using [Metamask](https://metamask.io). In the near future we will be releasing NFTs that give you access to Microdose builds & other assets when held in your wallet.

- User avatars
- Metamask wallet linking
- Assets now include products linked by NFTs (more info coming soon)
- UI refresh
- User profile cleanup
